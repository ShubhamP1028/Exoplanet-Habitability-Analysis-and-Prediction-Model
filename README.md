# Exoplanet-Analysis# 🪐 Exoplanet Habitability Analysis & KOI Classification

An end-to-end data science project built using Kepler exoplanet data. This project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, habitability scoring, exploratory analysis, classification modeling, and a fully interactive Streamlit dashboard.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to explore and classify Kepler Objects of Interest (KOIs) to determine their potential **habitability** and disposition using scientific metrics and machine learning.

The complete pipeline includes:

1. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  
2. 🧪 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. 🛠️ Feature Engineering  
4. 🌍 Habitability Scoring System  
5. 🎯 KOI Disposition Classification (Machine Learning)  
6. 📊 Visualizations

## 🌐 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Loaded `KeplerExoRaw.csv`
- Removed columns with excessive missing values
- Handled missing data via imputation
- Converted types and removed duplicates

### 2. 🛠️ Feature Engineering
- Created features like:
  - `pos_diff_mdec`, `pos_diff_msky`: positional differences
  - `avg_err_mdec`: average error
  - `total_pos_diff`: total spatial noise
  - Encoded categorical flags
  - Extracted vetting year

### 3. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Distributions of planetary and stellar features
- Correlation heatmaps
- Trends across vetting years
- Comparison of features across KOI classes

### 4. 🌍 Habitability Scoring System
Planets scored from 0 to 3 based on:

| Feature              | Ideal Range            |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| Radius              | 0.5 – 1.5 Earth radii  |
| Equilibrium Temp    | 200 – 320 Kelvin       |
| Positional Noise    | Total diff < 0.1       |

Each flag contributes 1 point to the `habitability_score`.

### 5. 🎯 KOI Disposition Classification
- Goal: Predict KOI disposition:  
  `CANDIDATE`, `CONFIRMED`, `FALSE POSITIVE`, `NOT DISPOSITIONED`
- Features used:
  - Engineered features + habitability score
- Algorithms:
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Metrics:
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
  - PCA Visualization
